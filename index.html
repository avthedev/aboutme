    <section>
      <p class="align-left">
        After graduating college with an Human Resources degree, I wanted to
        expand my skills that could lead to a different career path. I was
        always interested in coding but was too afraid of its complexity. Little did I know, the complexion is what makes learning it very
        interesting and challenging. It is like learning new languages but also
        trying to solve complex puzzles all the time. 
      </p>
      <p class ="align-middle"> My current goals are:</p>
      <ol class="align-middle">
        <li>Become proficient at coding</li>
        <li>Create awesome projects</li>
        <li>Graduate from Thinkful</li>
        <li>Find a job as a software engineer</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class ="align-middle">
        Aside from coding, my interests are cooking and sports. I love finding new recipes and adjusting them to eventually become my own. With sports, I like exposing myself to all different kind of sports. Once I get into it, I try to improve at it everytime I play.
      </p>
      <p class ="align-middle">
        I am currently a student at <a href ="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, where I am going on an expedition to master the craft of web development. If you are looking to hire a new developer or would like to work on a project together, I would be happy to work with fellow developers!
